# UFOs

# Analysis Overview:

For this client we've built an HTML webpage that pulls data from a JavaScript file and allows us to filter through the data via multiple criteria. Filters are the best way to go when dealing with data of this proportions, specially since there are so many UFO sightings thoughout the U.S. and using multiple criteria to breakdown the dat is of utmost help to better understand the content.

From the moment you land on the page and deboard your spaceship you will encounter at the very top left-hand side of the webpage a 'navigation link' titled 'UFO Sightings'. On the top center you will find the title of the webpage, 'The Truth Is Out There', with an image of earth in the foreground. Right beneath the main title you can read all about the article, which is separated into two sections using 'Bootstrap'. On the left-hand side of this section you can locate the title of the article. Below the section aforementioned we have the 'UFO Sightings' data in it's entirety. To the left, you will find multiple filters, such as: 'Enter Date', 'Enter City', 'Enter State, 'Enter Country', and 'Enter Shape'. All of these filters can be used to navigate and extrapolate specific tidbits of the 'UFO Sightings' data, by inputting the required information in each filter. Once a value has been entered in one of the filters the data will update automatically, without the need of any further action.
